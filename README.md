# aerth-context-engine

The core of the Ã†RTH system is a Data Context Engine (DCE) that facilitates reliable synthesis of multiple data sources.

Two key aspects make up the DCE.
- LLM (acts like a portal to query the data sources effectively): Query context layer

- Use ML and Statistical Modeling to find correlations between variables (e.g. ecoystems)
    - Multimodal Data Integration

- Visualize them


### Collected Information 

- [Emerging Architecture for LLM Application](https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/) 


Architecture solutions:

- LLM finetuned for earth related datasets. (The llm acts like a database that is easy to query)


with Knowlege Graphs
- LLM -> KG -> query KG using LLMs



## Possible Solutions

#### (1) Building Scalable Knowledge Graphs for Earth

What is a Knowledge Graph?
    - Knowledge Graphs link key entities in a specific domain with other entities via relationships.


Untapped resource of knowledge for a given domain is stored in papers and technical reports (unstructured). 
    - Difficult to extract and infer knowledge at scale

    - Language Models are Open Knowledge Graphs, [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11967)


## Aerth Business

1. Data Trust: Bringing together Data Providers in a trust, that get access to the AI model (license)
2. Aerth is responsible for engineering the AERTH-Context-Engine which gets licensed to institutions.

Questions to be answered:
- What do these models solve, what kind of information do the institutions etc. wanted to be answered (reliably)?
- How to monetize the aerth-context-engine?
- Incentives for the data trust collaborators?
