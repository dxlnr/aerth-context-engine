# aerth-context-engine

The core of the Ã†RTH system is a Data Context Engine (DCE) that facilitates reliable synthesis of multiple data sources.

Two key aspects make up the DCE.
- LLM (acts like a portal to query the data sources effectively): Query context layer

- Use ML and Statistical Modeling to find correlations between variables (e.g. ecoystems)
    - Multimodal Data Integration

- Visualize them
